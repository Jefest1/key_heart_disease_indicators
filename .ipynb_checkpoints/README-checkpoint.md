# Heart Disease Prediction Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction Project! This project aims to analyze key indicators of heart diseases and develop a predictive model to determine whether a person is likely to have a heart disease or not. 
By leveraging data-driven insights and machine learning techniques, our goal is to contribute to early detection and prevention of heart-related issues.

## Project Objectives
1. Data Analysis: Explore and analyze datasets containing relevant information about individuals' health and heart-related indicators.
2. Feature Selection: Identify and select key indicators that are most indicative of heart diseases based on the data analysis.
3. Model Development: Develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on selected features.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed model using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
5. User Interface to test the prediction model using flask API and Flasger's Swagger

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. <b>Data</b>: Contains the datasets used for analysis and model training.
2. <b>Notebooks</b>: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature selection, and model development.
3. <b>Scripts</b>: Python scripts for specific tasks such as API development.
4. <b>Models</b>: Stores the trained machine learning model(s) for predicting heart disease.

## Contributions
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features, feel free to submit a pull request.
